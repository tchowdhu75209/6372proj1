1) I didn't worry much about the outliers or Missing values.

2) Important observations- 
i) infant_deaths and under_five_deaths are highly correlated at 0.9969. I used under_five_deaths for model fit.
ii) thinness_5_9_years and thinness_1_19_years 0.9279;I used thinness_1_19_years for model fit.
iii) GDP and %expenditure are highly correlated at 0.9593. I kept both the vairables during model selection. GDP was always kicked out.

3) Transformations: Per my analysis, log transforms on the following variables made sense:
Life_expectancy
percentage_expenditure
Measles
under_five_deaths
HIV_AIDS 
Population

4) Final Model: Stepwise selection gave me the the same CVpress and same model. I checked ASE plots and also partitioned the data keeping 50% test data. 

PROC GLM DATA= LED plots = all; 
title "Custom Model WITH VARIABLES SELECTED FROM stepwise SELECTION "; 
class Status Country;
model log_Life_expectancy = Adult_Mortality  Alcohol log_percentage_expenditure    log_under_five_deaths  Diphtheria log_HIV_AIDS  Income_composition_of_resources Schooling / solution ;
output out = Customsel ;
run;

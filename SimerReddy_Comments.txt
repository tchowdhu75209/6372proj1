1) I didn't worry much about the outliers or Missing values.

2) Important observations- 
i) infant_deaths and under_five_deaths are highly correlated at 0.9969. I used under_five_deaths for model fit.
ii) thinness_5_9_years and thinness_1_19_years 0.9279;I used thinness_1_19_years for model fit.
iii) GDP and %expenditure are highly correlated at 0.9593. I kept both the vairables during model selection. GDP was always kicked out.

3) Transformations: Per my analysis, log transforms on the following variables made sense:
Life_expectancy
percentage_expenditure
Measles
under_five_deaths
HIV_AIDS 
Population

4) Final Model: Stepwise selection gave me the the same CVpress and same model. I checked ASE plots and also partitioned the data keeping 50% test data. 

PROC GLM DATA= LED plots = all; 
title "Custom Model WITH VARIABLES SELECTED FROM stepwise SELECTION "; 
class Status Country;
model log_Life_expectancy = Adult_Mortality  Alcohol log_percentage_expenditure    log_under_five_deaths  Diphtheria log_HIV_AIDS  Income_composition_of_resources Schooling / solution ;
output out = Customsel ;
run;

5) I think I should take 'Country' out of the model. What do you think?
6) As part of the EDA, I think it'll be good to provide 
i) a histogram showing median Life expectancy by 'status'.
ii) Scatter plot of 'Life expectancy' and only the 'selected' variables.

6) knn
I am getting error in KNN code while trying to create the confusion matrix (line iii):
  i)  knn1 <- knn(train_data[,3:Number_of_Cols],test_data[,3:Number_of_Cols],train_data$Attrition, k=i )#ERROR if data not normalized
    ii)t_knn <- table(knn1, test_data$Attrition)
    iii) CM_knn <- confusionMatrix(t_knn)
    #Capture Accuracy
    #ACC <- CM_knn$overall[1]
    Acc[seed,i] = CM_knn$overall[1]
